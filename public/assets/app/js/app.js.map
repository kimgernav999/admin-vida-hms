As long as the lock is displayed closed your information is secure and encrypted to avoid abuse.

SSL encrypts all communications between your computer and our server so that the information can only be read and understood by us. Usually a closed lock on your browser window shows a secure connection. For further information, please consult your browser’s security specifications. If your browser is equipped with SSL your transaction will automatically be secured. The common standard in the Internet to signal a secure site is a closed lock at the bottom of the browser. As long as the lock is displayed closed your information is secure and encrypted to avoid abuse. If you click the secure transaction link and still cannot see the closed lock, the reason may be that the window is in nested in another frame.</p>\\n                    <div class=\\\"separator separator-lightgray mb-4\\\"></div>\\n                    <h3 class=\\\"my-4\\\">Intellectual property rights</h3>\\n                    <p>The Website and its entire contents, features and functionality (including but not limited to all information, software, text, displays, images, video and audio, and the design, selection and arrangement thereof), are owned by the Company, its licensors or other providers of such material and are protected by United Arab Emirates and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.</p>\\n                    <p>These Terms of Use permit you to use the Website for your personal, non-commercial use only.
